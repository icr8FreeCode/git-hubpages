What are Python Turtles?
========================

One of the strengths of Python is that we can pull in ready-made features to
make building our own programs easier. Instead of figuring out how to do all of
the nitty-gritty details ourselves, we can use a *module* that already contains
the code we need. Think of a module like a plug-and-play attachment for your
phone or computer. All you need to do to use a module is import it.

There are many modules in Python that provide very powerful features. Some of
these can send email or fetch web pages. Others allow us to perform complex
mathematical calculations.

In this chapter we use a module that allows us to create an object called a
``turtle`` that can be used to draw pictures.

Drawing **turtle graphics** is based on a very simple metaphor. Imagine you
have a pet turtle who understands English. You give your turtle simple commands
such as, "Go forward," and, "Turn right." As the turtle moves around, if its
tail is down touching the ground, it will draw a line (leave a trail behind) as
it moves. If you tell your turtle to lift up its tail, it can still move around
but will not leave a trail.

Given it's simplicity, you can still make some pretty amazing drawings with
the turtle module.

.. admonition:: Note

   Turtles are fun! As you use this book to practice Python and learn
   to think like a programmer, we will use turtles from time to time to liven
   things up.
