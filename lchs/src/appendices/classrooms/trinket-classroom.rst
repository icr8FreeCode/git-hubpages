Trinket Courses
===============

A Trinket *course* provides students with the ability to create code and then
submit it to their teachers. It also allows teachers to post instructions,
track their students' work, and provide feedback.

Assignments can only be accessed by people enrolled in the course, and student
work can only be seen by the instructors.

A course is used to:

#. Create a learning space where teachers can post lessons, practice exercises,
   and assignments.
#. Organize coding tasks,
#. Complete and submit practice tasks and assignments,
#. Provide feedback for working or non-working code.

   will submit your work to your teacher.
