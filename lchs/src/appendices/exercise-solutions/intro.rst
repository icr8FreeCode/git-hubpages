A Note About The Solutions
==========================

Think of a physical math or science textbook. At the end of most chapters, the
authors include a set of practice exercises. To help students check their work,
the authors also provide *answers* to those problems. Some books give all of
the answers, while others give solutions for just the odd or even problems. 

Our online textbook is not so different! In the following pages, you wil find
answers to many of the chapter problems. However, due to the nature of the
questions, we can't always provide a clean odd/even pattern.

Chapter Sandboxes
-----------------

.. index:: ! sandbox

Developers often create a small project called a **sandbox**. They use the file
to test out bits of code, experiment with small ideas, or problem solve. The
code in the file isn't meant to be saved on its own. If a block of code looks
promising, the programmer can copy and paste it from their sandbox into a real
life project. The next time a new problem or idea pops up, the programmer wipes
their sandbox clean and then starts playing.

The answers in this appendix are displayed as code blocks. However, it often
helps to see how a solution runs. Each page includes a *chapter sandbox*. If
you want to see a solution in action, just copy the code from the text and
paste it into the sandbox.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Indentation matters! Python isn't picky about whether you indent by 2 or 3
   or 4 spaces, but you MUST be consistent within a code block. One difficulty
   with copy/pasting code is that the *editor* might indent lines by a
   different amount compared to the *text*. After a paste, be sure to check the
   indentation. This is especially true if you type some of your own lines into
   the editor.

   You can adjust the amount of indentation by highlighting one or more lines
   of code and tapping *Tab* to indent more or *Control-Tab* (*Command-Tab* on
   a Mac) to un-indent.
