Before You Begin
================

For the remaining chapters of this book, we will use a *local* code editor.
This is an application that we run directly on our personal devices instead of
online through a browser.

.. index:: ! Visual Studio Code, ! IDE, ! Visual Studio Code

Programmers use **integrated development environments** (IDE) to write and run
their code. The IDE we will use for this course is called **Visual Studio
Code**. In addition to writing and running code, VSCode has tools that
help us spot errors in our work. It also includes a terminal that we can use to
move through our filesystem.

If you are a student and using a device provided by your school, both VSCode
and Python should already be installed on your machine. If you are working
through this textbook on your own, you may need to perform some installations
before continuing.

Instructions for installing VSCode and the Python programming language can be
found in the :ref:`Setting up Software <software-installations>` appendix.

Chromebook Users
----------------

If you are using a school-owned device, you should have access to a *virtual
desktop* that holds all of the necessary software. Follow your teacher's
instructions for logging in to this service.
