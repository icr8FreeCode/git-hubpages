More About Programs
===================

A *program* tells a computer how to complete a task, which might be something
as simple as adding two numbers together or as complex as following voice
commands.

Every program you've ever used is made up of instructions that do these same basic tasks:

#. **Input**: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
#. **Output**: Display data on the screen, or send data to a file or other
   device.
#. **Math**: Perform basic calculations like addition and multiplication.
#. **Logic and decision making**: Check for certain conditions and run the
   correct code statements based on those conditions.
#. **Repetition**: Quickly perform the same action over and over again.

We can describe programming as the process of breaking a large problem or task
into smaller and smaller pieces. Once these pieces are small enough, we can
solve each one with a few of the basic operations listed above. By combining
the small solutions, our programs complete much bigger tasks.

The single most important skill for a programmer is *problem solving*.
Problem solving means the ability to examine a problem, break it into smaller
pieces, think creatively about how to solve those pieces, and clearly describe
those solutions.

As you learn how to code, you will also develop your problem solving skills.

.. admonition:: Question

   A program is:

   .. raw:: html

      <ol type="a">
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, true)"> a set of instructions for performing a task</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> something you read at a play or concert.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> a calculation.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> the same thing as an algorithm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p id="Q1"></p>
