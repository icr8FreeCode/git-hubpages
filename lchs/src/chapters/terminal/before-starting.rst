Before You Begin
================

.. index:: ! local development

It is time to shift our focus away from online code editors and towards
**local development**. In the remaining chapters, you will run applications
installed on your personal device instead of using scaled down versions inside
a web browser. Creating programs locally gives you more control over the
organization, security, and structure of your programs. It also allows you to
use more flexible and powerful tools.

If you are a student and using a device provided by your school, all of the
required software should already be installed on your machine. If you are
working through this textbook on your own, you may need to perform some
installations before continuing.

Instructions for installing the necessary software on your machine can be found
in the :ref:`Setting up Software <software-installations>` appendix. In this
chapter, we introduce one new program: the Terminal (called *Git Bash* on a
Windows machine). Check to make sure you have this application on your device.

Chromebook Users
----------------

If you are using a school-owned device, you should have access to a *virtual
desktop* that holds all of the necessary software. Follow your teacher's
instructions for logging in to this service.

Replit Users
------------

Instead of terminal, Replit has a shell tab. You will be able to add files, 
folders and navagate within your current repl. Follow your teacher's 
instructions and modifications for this chapter.
