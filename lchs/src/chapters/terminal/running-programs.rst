Running Programs from the Terminal
==================================

Quickly moving through our filesystem is just one benefit of using the
terminal. We can also run our code inside of the terminal and see its output.

The commands for running a program in the terminal vary widely based on the
coding language of that program. For this course, we will focus on Python.

.. admonition:: Example

   In our online repl.it and Trinket editors, we execute our programs by
   clicking the *Run* button. If we saved the code on our computer instead, we
   could run them from the terminal by typing ``python file_name``.

   We will explore this idea in the next chapter.

Exiting Programs
----------------

Let's say there is an error in our code, like an infinite loop. If we launch
the program from the terminal, how do we get it to stop?

The repl.it and Trinket editors also include a *Stop* button for just this type
of situation. The matching action for the terminal is *Control+c*. Pressing
both keys at the same time will usually stop a process that is currently
running. If that doesn't work, try entering the ``exit`` command to stop the
program.

If *Control+c* and ``exit`` don't work, ask the teacher for help!
