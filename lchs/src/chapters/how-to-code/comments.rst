Adding Comments
===============

As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read.
Good programmers try to make their code understandable to others. 
However, even with Python, it is still tricky to look at a large program and figure out what is going on.

The best coders add notes to their code to clearly explain what the program is
doing. These notes are called *comments*.

A **comment** is text within a program intended only for a human reader---it is
skipped when the program runs. In Python, the ``#`` character starts a comment,
and the rest of the line gets ignored.

Try It!
-------

Experiment by adding and removing comments to the code.

.. raw:: html

   <iframe height="650px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@launchcode/LCHS-Comments?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="yes" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

Notice that when you run the program, it still prints the phrase ``Hello,
World``, but none of the comments appear. Also, notice the compiler ignores the blank lines left in the code.

Comments and blank lines make your programs much easier for humans to read. Use
them often!

.. admonition:: Question

   What are comments for?

   .. raw:: html

      <ol type="a">
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> To tell the computer what you mean in your program.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, true)"> To help people reading your code know what the program is doing.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> Nothing, they contain information that is not needed.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> Nothing in a short program. They are only needed for really large programs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p id="Q1"></p>
