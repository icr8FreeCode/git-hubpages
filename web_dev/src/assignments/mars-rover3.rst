Mars Rover, Part 3
==================

With :ref:`Part 2 <mars-rover2>` completed, let's turn our attention to the final class, the ``Rover`` class.

``Rover``
---------

``Rover`` receives a message object, updates its properties from the message, and 
returns the results.

Remember to use TDD by first reading the class description, writing tests, and then coding the class.

.. _rover-class:

Rover Class Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This class builds a rover object with a few properties, and it also contains
a function outside of ``constructor`` to handle updates to its properties.

#. ``constructor(position)``

   a. ``position`` is a number representing the rover's position.
   b. Sets ``this.position`` to ``position``
   c. Sets ``this.mode`` to ``'NORMAL'``
   d. Sets default value for ``generatorWatts`` to 110

#. ``receiveMessage(message)``

   a. ``message`` is a ``Message`` object
   b. Returns an object containing at least two properties:
         
      i. ``message``: the name of the original ``Message`` object
      ii. ``results``: an array of *results*. Each element in the array is an 
          object that corresponds to one ``Command`` in ``message.commands``.
         
   c. Updates certain properties of the rover object

      i. Details about how to respond to different commands are in the
         :ref:`Command Types table <command-types-table>`.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: js

      let commands = [new Command('MODE_CHANGE', 'LOW_POWER'), new Command('STATUS_CHECK')];
      let message = new Message('Test message with two commands', commands);
      let rover = new Rover(98382);    // Passes 98382 as the rover's position.
      let response = rover.receiveMessage(message);

      console.log(response);

   **Output**

   ::

      {
         message: 'Test message with two commands',
         results: [
            {
               completed: true
            },
            {
               completed: true, 
               roverStatus: { mode: 'LOW_POWER', generatorWatts: 110, position: 98382 }
            }
         ]
      }

``Rover`` Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create ``spec/rover.spec.js`` and write the following tests. Write the code to
make them pass in ``rover.js``. Remember to use the given phrase as the test
description.

Test 7 
~~~~~~

"constructor sets position and default values for mode and generatorWatts".
Refer to the :ref:`Rover Class <rover-class>` description above for these
default values.

Test 8
~~~~~~

"response returned by receiveMessage contains name of message"

Test 9
~~~~~~

"response returned by receiveMessage includes two results if two commands
are sent in the message"

Test 10
~~~~~~~

"responds correctly to status check command"

a. For the ``STATUS_CHECK`` command, ``receiveMessage(message).results`` 
   includes a ``roverStatus`` object describing the current state of the 
   rover object --- ``mode``, ``generatorWatts``, and ``position``. The test 
   should check each of these for accuracy.
b. See the :ref:`Rover Command Types <command-types-table>` table for more
   details.

Test 11
~~~~~~~

"responds correctly to mode change command". 

a. The test should check the ``completed`` property and rover mode for accuracy.
b. The rover has two modes that can be passed a values to a mode change command,
   'LOW_POWER' and 'NORMAL'.

Test 12
~~~~~~~

"responds with false completed value when attempting to move in LOW_POWER
mode". 

a. The test should check the ``completed`` property for accuracy and confirm 
   that the rover position did not change.
b. Use the :ref:`Rover Modes table <rover-modes-table>` for guidance on how
   to handle move commands in different modes.

Test 13
~~~~~~~

"responds with position for move command".

a. A ``MOVE`` command will update the rover's position with the position value in 
   the command.

.. _command-types-table:

Rover Command Types
--------------------
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Value sent with command
     - Updates to ``Rover`` object
     - Result returned
   * - MOVE
     - Number representing the position the rover should move to.
     - ``position``
     - ``{completed: true}``
   * - STATUS_CHECK
     - No values sent with this command.
     - No updates
     - ``{completed: true, roverStatus: {mode: 'NORMAL', generatorWatts: 110, position: 87382098}}`` Values for ``mode``, ``generatorWatts``, ``position`` will depend on current state of rover.
   * - MODE_CHANGE
     - String representing rover mode (see modes)
     - ``mode``
     - ``{completed: true}``

.. note::

   The response value for ``completed`` will be ``false`` if the command could
   NOT be completed.

.. _rover-modes-table:

Rover Modes
-----------
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode
     - Restrictions
   * - LOW_POWER
     - Can't be moved in this state.
   * - NORMAL
     - None
