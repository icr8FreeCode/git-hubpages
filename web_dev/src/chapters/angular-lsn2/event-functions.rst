Events Can Call Functions
==========================

For the user input practice, we set the ``keyup`` and ``click`` events equal to
``true``. This just checks to see if these events occur. When they do, the
input is stored in ``newMovie``, and the page refreshes.

To perform more complicated tasks in response to the user's actions, we can
call a function when an event occurs. The syntax for this is:

::

   (event) = "functionName(arguments...)"

Changing the movie list displayed on the web page requires us to modify the
``movies`` array in the ``movie-list.component.ts`` file. We will do this by
creating an ``addMovie`` function and linking it to our event handlers.

Modify the HTML
----------------

Let's change our code in ``movie-list.component.html`` to call the function
``addMovie`` and pass the new movie title as the argument.

#. On lines 7 and 8, replace ``true`` with the function call:

   .. sourcecode:: html+ng2
      :linenos:

      <div class='movies col-4'>
         <h3>Movies to Watch</h3>
         <ol>
            <li *ngFor ="let movie of movies">{{movie}}</li>
         </ol>
         <hr>
         <input #newMovie (keyup.enter)='addMovie(newMovie.value)' type='text' placeholder="Enter Movie Title Here"/>
         <button (click)='addMovie(newMovie.value)'>Add</button>
         <p>{{newMovie.value}}</p>
      </div>

   Now when the user taps "Enter" or clicks the "Add" button after typing, the
   input ``newMovie.value`` gets sent to the function.

#. Since our plan is to use a function to add the new movie to the array, we no
   longer need the title to appear below the input box. Remove
   ``<p>{{newMovie.value}}</p>`` from line 9.

Define the Function
--------------------

Open ``movie-list.component.ts`` and examine the code:

.. sourcecode:: TypeScript
   :linenos:

   import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
      selector: 'movie-list',
      templateUrl: './movie-list.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./movie-list.component.css']
   })
   export class MovieListComponent implements OnInit {
      movies = ['Toy Story', 'The Shining', 'Sleepless in Seattle', 'The Martian'];

      constructor() { }

      ngOnInit() {
      }
   }

The ``movies`` array stores the titles displayed on the web page, and we want to
update this when the user supplies new information.

3. Declare a function called ``addMovie`` that takes one parameter:

   .. sourcecode:: TypeScript
      :linenos:

      export class MovieListComponent implements OnInit {
         movies = ['Toy Story', 'The Shining', 'Sleepless in Seattle', 'The Martian'];

         constructor() { }

         ngOnInit() {
         }

         addMovie (newTitle: string) {

         }
      }

   Notice that we have to declare the data type for the ``newTitle`` parameter.

#. Now add code to ``push`` the new title to the ``movies`` array:

   .. sourcecode:: TypeScript
      :linenos:

      export class MovieListComponent implements OnInit {
         movies = ['Toy Story', 'The Shining', 'Sleepless in Seattle', 'The Martian'];

         constructor() { }

         ngOnInit() {
         }

         addMovie (newTitle: string) {
            this.movies.push(newTitle);
         }
      }

   The keyword ``this`` is required.

.. admonition:: Note

   It is a common practice to put ``constructor`` and functions like
   ``ngOnInit`` AFTER the variable declarations but BEFORE any custom
   functions.

Save the changes and then refresh the page. Enter a new title to verify that it
appears in the movie list. Your page should look something like:

.. figure:: ./figures/new-movie-added.png
   :alt: Updated movie list.

Tidying Up the Display
-----------------------

Notice that after adding a new movie to the list, the text remains in the input
box. If we click "Add" multiple times in a row, we would see something like:

.. figure:: ./figures/repeated-movie.png
   :alt: Same movie added multiple times.

Let's modify the code to try to prevent this from happening.

Clear the Input Box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5. After the user submits a new title, we can clear the input box by setting its
   value to be the empty string (``''``). Open ``movie-list.component.html``
   and modify the input statement as follows:

   .. sourcecode:: html+ng2

      <input #newMovie (keyup.enter)="addMovie(newMovie.value); newMovie.value = ''" type="text" placeholder="Enter Movie Title Here"/>

   When ``keyup.enter`` occurs, the code calls ``addMovie``. Once control
   returns from the function, ``newMovie.value`` is set equal to ``''``, which
   clears any text from the input box.

#. Since the user can also click the "Add" button to submit a title, we need to
   modify the ``<button>`` element as well:

   .. sourcecode:: html+ng2

      <button (click)="addMovie(newMovie.value); newMovie.value = ''">Add</button>

   Now ``newMovie.value`` is set equal to ``''``, when "Enter" or "Add" are used
   to submit data.

.. admonition:: Try It

   Refresh the page and verify that the input box gets cleared after each new
   title.

Check for Duplicates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Even though we clear the input box, there is nothing to prevent the user from
entering the same movie multiple times. While some fans may want to watch a
film twenty times in a row, let's have our code prevent repeats.

Recall that the :ref:`includes method <includes-examples>` checks if an array
contains a particular element. The method gives us several ways to check for a
repeated title. One possibility is:

.. sourcecode:: TypeScript
   :linenos:

   addMovie (newTitle: string) {
      if(!this.movies.includes(newTitle)){
         this.movies.push(newTitle);
      }
   }

If the ``movies`` array already contains ``newTitle``, then the ``includes``
method returns ``true``. The NOT operator (``!``) flips the result to
``false``, and line 3 is skipped.

.. admonition:: Try It

   Refresh the page and verify that you cannot enter a duplicate title.

Bonus
------

To boost your skills, try these optional tasks to enhance your work:

#. Modify ``addMovie`` to reject the empty string as a title.
#. Use ``*ngIf`` to display an error message if the user does not enter a title
   or submits a title that is already on the list.
#. Add CSS to change the color of the error message.

The ``example-solutions`` branch of the Angular repo shows completed code for
the bonus tasks.

Check Your Understanding
-------------------------

Assume that we have an Angular project that presents users with a list of
potential pets:

.. figure:: ./figures/pet-list.png
   :alt: Potential pet list.

.. admonition:: Question

   Which of the following calls the ``addPet`` function when the user clicks
   on one of the potential pets:

   #. ``<li>{{pet}}</li>``
   #. ``<li (click) = "true">{{pet}}</li>``
   #. ``<li #addPet (click) = "true">{{pet}}</li>``
   #. ``<li (click) = "addPet(pet)">{{pet}}</li>``

.. admonition:: Question

   When the user moves the mouse over an animal, we want to store its name in
   the ``newFriend`` variable. Which of the following accomplishes this?

   #. ``<li (mouseover) = "pet.name">{{pet}}</li>``
   #. ``<li #newFriend (mouseover) = "pet.name">{{pet}}</li>``
   #. ``<li (mouseover) = "newFriend = pet.name">{{pet}}</li>``
   #. ``<li (mouseover) = "newFriend">{{pet}}</li>``
