Classes and Interfaces in TypeScript
====================================

Classes
-------

Classes in TypeScript look something like this:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   class Astronaut {
      name: string;
      constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
         this.name = firstName + " " + lastName;
      }
      greet() {
         return "Hello, " + this.name;
      }
   }

   let Bob = new Astronaut("Bob","Smith");

You may remember the ``this`` and ``new`` keywords from working with classes in
JavaScript. Earlier in the chapter, we also noted that when declaring variables
in TypeScript, we have to specify the type of value. The same applies to
function parameters, as you can see in the constructor.

When :ref:`using inheritance <inheritance>`, classes in TypeScript can also use
the ``extends`` keyword to denote child and parent classes, as shown here:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   class Panthera {
      roar: string;
      constructor(currentRoar: string) {
         this.roar = currentRoar;
      }
   }

   class Tiger extends Panthera {
      stripes: boolean = true;

   }

   let tigger = new Tiger("loud");
   console.log(tigger.roar);
   console.log(tigger.stripes);

Interfaces
----------

Interfaces are not used in JavaScript, but are important in TypeScript.
Like classes, interfaces define properties and methods that a type will
have. The difference is that interfaces do NOT include initialization of
properties or implementations of methods.

.. note:: 

   Though the use of interfaces in Angular is not within the scope of this book, interfaces are used rather frequently in Angular code and are important in object-oriented programming languages, such as Java.

We may create an interface for a data type that contains all of the information
we need about an astronaut and then use that information in a function.

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   interface Astronaut {
      name: string;
   }

   function astronautName (astronaut: Astronaut): string {
      return astronaut.name;
   }

   let bob = {name: "Bob"};
   console.log(astronautName(bob));

Interfaces define the contract that other classes or objects must comply with if implementing that interface.
Multiple classes can implement one interface, and that flexibility allows different classes to share one type.
This can be helpful when a function parameter needs to make use of certain behaviors.

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   interface interfaceName {
      someProperty: number;
   }

   class className implements interfaceName {
      constructor(x: number) {
         this.someProperty = x;
      }
   }

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: js
      :linenos:

      interface Panthera {
         roar: string;
      }

      class Tiger implements Panthera {
         roar: string;

         constructor() {
            this.roar = 'rooooaaaarrrr';
         }
      }

      class Lion implements Panthera {
         roar: string;

         constructor() {
            this.roar = 'ROOOOAAAAARRRRRR';
         }
      }

      function pantheraSounds(panthera: Panthera): void {
         console.log(`Panthera says ${panthera.roar}`);
      }

      let tiger = new Tiger();
      let lion = new Lion();

      pantheraSounds(tiger);
      pantheraSounds(lion);

   In this example, the ``Panthera`` interface defines the ``roar`` property. ``Tiger`` and ``Lion`` implement the ``Panthera`` interface,
   which means ``Tiger`` and ``Lion`` must have a ``roar`` property.

   The function ``pantheraSounds`` has one parameter of type ``Panthera``. The variables ``tiger`` and ``lion`` can be passed into ``pantheraSounds``
   because they are instances of classes that implement the ``Panthera`` interface.

Optional Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``null`` and ``undefined`` are primitive data types in TypeScript, however, they are treated differently by TypeScript.
If you are planning on using ``null`` to define a property of an interface that is not known yet, use the TypeScript optional parameter, ``?``.

Let's take a look at how that would look in TypeScript.

In JavaScript, we might have an object that looks like so:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   let giraffeTwo = {
        species: "Reticulated Giraffe",
        name: "Alicia",
        weight: null,
        age: 10,
        diet: "leaves"
   };

If we wanted to declare the same object as an interface in TypeScript, we would have to use the optional parameter for the ``weight`` property.

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   interface giraffeTwo = {
        species: string;
        name: string;
        weight?: number;
        age: number;
        diet: string;
   };

``export``
----------

In TypeScript, you can use the ``export`` keyword to make classes and interfaces available for import in other files.
This will look familiar to you as you saw something similar with :ref:`modules <exporting-modules>`.

Using the ``export`` keyword looks something like this:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   export class className {
      // properties and methods
   }

``import``
----------

In TypeScript, you can use the ``import`` keyword to use classes and interfaces declared in other files available for use in the file you are working on.
This is a similar idea to :ref:`importing modules <require-modules>`, however, the syntax is different in TypeScript:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   import { className } from 'relativefilepath';

   let newClass = new className;
