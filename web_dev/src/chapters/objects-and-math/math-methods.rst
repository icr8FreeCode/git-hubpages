Math Methods
=============

As with strings and arrays, JavaScript provides some built-in *methods* for the
``Math`` object. These allow us to perform calculations or tasks that are more
involved than simple multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction.

Common Math Methods
--------------------

The ``Math`` object contains over 30 methods. The table below provides a sample
of the most frequently used options. More complete lists can be found here:

#. `W3 Schools Math Reference <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp>`__
#. `MDN Web Docs <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math>`__

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Syntax
     - Description
   * - :ref:`abs <abs-examples>`
     - ``Math.abs(number)``
     - Returns the positive value of ``number``.

   * - :ref:`ceil <ceilfloortrunc-examples>`
     - ``Math.ceil(number)``
     - Rounds the decimal ``number`` UP to the closest integer value.

   * - :ref:`floor <floor>`
     - ``Math.floor(number)``
     - Rounds the decimal ``number`` DOWN to the closest integer value.

   * - :ref:`max <max-and-min-examples>`
     - ``Math.max(x,y,z,...)``
     - Returns the largest value from a set of numbers.

   * - :ref:`min <min>`
     - ``Math.min(x,y,z,...)``
     - Returns the smallest value from a set of numbers.

   * - :ref:`pow <pow-examples>`
     - ``Math.pow(x,y)``
     - Returns the value of x raised to the power of y (x :sup:`y`).

   * - :ref:`random <random-examples>`
     - ``Math.random()``
     - Returns a random decimal value between 0 and 1, NOT including 1.

   * - :ref:`round <round-examples>`
     - ``Math.round(number)``
     - Returns ``number`` rounded to the nearest integer value.

   * - :ref:`sqrt <square-root>`
     - ``Math.sqrt(number)``
     - Returns the square root of ``number``.

   * - :ref:`trunc <trunc>`
     - ``Math.trunc(number)``
     - Removes any decimals and returns the integer part of ``number``.
